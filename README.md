# PR Finder VSCode Extension

**_Reduce the development feedback loop and ship code quicker!_**

Introducing PR Finder, a developer's best friend for being automatically notified about pull requests in the repositories that you care about.

</p>

Select repos you want to track and PR Finder will send you a notification when a pull request has been submitted. Once reviewed or merged, the PR will be marked off the list - making way for new PRs to review.

PR Finder works with all types of repos, including organisation repos - except for GitHub Enterprise (support planned for Enterprise at a later date).

Use PR Finder to save the pain in notifying your teammates about PRs and let PR Finder do the hard work for you without any dither or delay.
